Browsers freeze when saving n reloading idk why

Fix Search Bar for responsivnes
'Content is Loading' is somewhere moved too much to left/right - Too much at Profile Page
Maybe to find a better color for news section
When screen is smaller move buttons at Home page down a bit
Check 393px if you're bored
Three dots when Username History is too Long (same as users list box)

* Check responsive at User Lookup for 414px, 412px, 375px etc.

== BACKEND ==

Search Users at Users Page
Discord Servers/Minecraft Servers/Paid Ads System, smthn like that
Administration Panel, admins can approve ads/servers smthng like that
Some sort of customization of Profile
